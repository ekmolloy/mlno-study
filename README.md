Maximum Likelihood Network Orientation (MLNO) Study
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Case Study

### Model Data Sets
This directory contains the scripts used to compute the *f*-statistics implied by the demographic models from our case study as well as seven prior studies. It also contains the *f*-statistic data sets and pictures of the graph topologies.

### Simulated Data Sets
This directory contains the scripts used to simulate data sets for benchmarking TreeMix and TreeMix-MLNO. It also contains the sample covariance matrix, the *f2*-statistic matrix, and the standard error for the entries of these matrices for all model conditions evaluated in the simulation study.
